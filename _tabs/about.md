As I embark on learning a bit more about cryptography, I've found it useful to write down worked examples that demonstrate some of the themes and concepts.

Additionally, as I work through some of these topics, a set of additional questions have emerged that I'd like to explore further.

An important note: I'm not an authority on these topics at all, I'm working my way through a few books, video series and online articles, and find worked examples help in my understanding.  Nothing documented in any of my posts should be considered authoritative, but hopefully some of the examples might aid others in their understanding.

Some specific references that I've found very useful;

- [Bulletproof TLS and PKI by Ivan Ristić](https://www.feistyduck.com/books/bulletproof-tls-and-pki/)
- [The cryptopals crypto challenges](https://cryptopals.com/)
- [Understanding Cryptography by Christof Paar, Jan Pelzl & Tim Güneysu](https://www.cryptography-textbook.com/)
