I've had reason recently to consider the certificate options for client based authentication, having been challenged as to why one wouldn't just use a Public CA signed certificate when mTLS is in use between 2 separate parties/organisations.

I'll explore this within this post, however would highlight that use of mTLS may not be appropriate for this sort of use case regardless, but conceptually is an interesting topic to consider.

## Questions to explore

To further understanding, I'd like to explore the following questions and where applicable demonstrate answers:

- what properties of the client certificate are used to authenticate the client by the service?
- are certificate extensions applicable to client authentication?
- what are the common approaches to mTLS for various types of implementation?
- What are the conceptual characteristic differences between the following client certificate signing approaches:
    - self-signed
    - private CA signed
    - public CA signed
- are there any public CAs that consider client certificates differently?
